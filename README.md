An app to randomise the running order of students for Thunder talks, or similar situations.

There's about 500000 fruit related pages that we haven't refactored out yet, but that doesn't impact on user experience, it's just messier under the hood than it needs to be, currently.

To run:
npm install
npm run dev
browse to http://localhost:3000/#/
